## About
This is an Epicodus project for the Database Basics Assessment.
Users may add new stations and train lines to the database and associate train lines and stations in a many-to-many relationship. For example, the 15th Street Express and City Center Line trains may both stop at the City Center Station and Expo Quarter Station. Users may view all stations along a train line, and vice versa.
